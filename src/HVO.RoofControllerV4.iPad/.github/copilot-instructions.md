# HVO.RoofControllerV4.iPad Copilot Notes

## Simulator Deployment
- Always target the iOS simulator by UDID, not by display name. The current iPad simulator UUID is `F878E277-60EC-43CF-90EC-B1C9050549E6`.
- Drive manual runs with the following MSBuild command pattern:
  ```bash
  dotnet build src/HVO.RoofControllerV4.iPad/HVO.RoofControllerV4.iPad.csproj \
    -t:Run -f net9.0-ios \
    -p:_DeviceName=:v2:udid=F878E277-60EC-43CF-90EC-B1C9050549E6
  ```
  Failing to pass `_DeviceName` with the UDID causes deployment to select a default simulator and can trigger `KeyNotFoundException` errors at runtime.

## CommunityToolkit Popup Wiring
- `HealthStatusPopupViewModel` exposes an internal `Popup` property. `HealthStatusPopup` **must** assign `viewModel.Popup = this;` during construction so the dashboard can retrieve the live popup instance.
- `RoofControllerViewModel.EnsureHealthDialogPopupAsync` captures the popup instance from the view model and attaches the `Closed` handler. Do **not** reintroduce `IPopupLifecycleController`; the captured instance fulfills lifecycle tracking and avoids `Health status popup instance was not created.` exceptions.

## Logging & Monitoring
- Expect verbose HTTP polling in the simulator output while the roof controller dashboard is active. Focus on non-200 responses before investigating popup lifecycle issues.

Keep these notes in mind when updating the iPad project or debugging simulator runs.
